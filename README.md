born: April 12, 2001 (2001-04-12) [age 21]), better known online as iamLucid (or simply Lucid), is an American YouTuber currently living in Detroit, Michigan. He primarily uploads
VRChat
gameplay videos and commentary about the
internet
and self-control.


He was born on April 12th, 2001. He currently lives in
Dearborn
, Michigan.[2]
Lucid grew up playing video games with his cousins and he disliked school. He started off his YouTube career uploading Call of Duty and League of Legends gameplay under the channel name, "xGRAViiTY". During his early years in High School, he was obsessed with Lucid Dreaming and he got really good with it to the point where he Lucid Dreamed everyday. He uploaded Lucid Dreaming tutorials hence why his channel name is, "iamLucid". Lucid tried to stream on Twitch however he became more successful with his YouTube channel.

On August 29, 2021, Alex published a video titled "i leaked my ip address on stream then got ddosed" in which he explains that he's going to purposely turn off his VPN and leak his IP Address on stream.[3] Alex was aware, that as a streamer, it was guaranteed that he would be DDoS, hence is why, he used a second router to prevent his main router (the one that his family uses) so that he can only be affected by the attack. [4]

When the livestream started, he went on speedtest.net to show his download and upload but by also leaking his IP Address. A few minutes later after the IP was shown, the chat stopped[5] and the DDoS attack began.[6] When the DDoS attacks were over, the chat came back and people started to dox Alex by using his IP as a way to have an approximate location of his address[7] which he said that he does not live at the address that was shown in the video. [8]
After the stream was over, Alex continued by explaining that someone made a video[9] in which they claimed that his IP was posted on Reddit[10] and they showed "his house".[11] Afterwards, Alex explained why he's really cautious about his own safety online[12] and explains that he also flagged his house as a celebrity to his local authorities to prevent himself from being swatted.[13][14]
